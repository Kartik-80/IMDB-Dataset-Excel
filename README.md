# 🎬 IMDb Top 5000 TV Shows Analysis

This project dives deep into the top 5000 TV shows listed on IMDb. The original dataset was provided as a `.csv` file, but this repository includes the **cleaned and processed Excel version** of the project.

## 📁 Files Included
- `imdb_top_5000_tv_shows.xlsx` → My final solved and cleaned project file, containing:
  - Processed data
  - Charts and graphs
  - Insights and summaries

## 📊 What I Did
- Cleaned the raw `.csv` dataset for analysis
- Handled missing values, formatting issues, and inconsistent entries
- Analyzed trends in:
  - Ratings
  - Genres
  - Years of release
  - Language and countries
- Created visualizations to support findings

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Primary tool for data cleaning + visualizations)
- [Original dataset](#) (#The orignal dataset is the CSV file.)

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **Drama** and **Comedy** dominate the IMDb elite club.
- Peak TV era? The 2010s were pure gold.
- English-language shows rule, but global hits are on the rise 🌍
- Ratings cluster around the 7–9 mark — the crowd’s picky but fair!

## 🔮 Future Add-ons (Maybe a part 2 👀)
- Bring the project to life in Python or Power BI
- Use pivot tables and slicers for interactivity
- Predict top genres using trend analysis
